# Electrical Circuit Drawing and Simulation Program

## Overview
This program allows users to draw and simulate electrical circuits. It provides tools for creating schematic diagrams and performing circuit simulations to analyze the behavior of electrical circuits.

## Features
- Draw schematic diagrams of electrical circuits
- Simulate circuit behavior using SPICE engine
- Visualize simulation results with plots
- Support for AC, DC, and transient analysis

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, ensure you have Python installed and then install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage
### Drawing Circuits
1. Run the program.
2. Use the mouse to draw lines representing wires.
3. Click on endpoints to connect wires.

### Simulating Circuits
1. After drawing the circuit, select the simulation type (AC, DC, or transient).
2. Run the simulation to analyze the circuit behavior.
3. View the simulation results in the provided plots.
